# Sample-Code
This is two sample-code files from a Remy-Martin campaign:

1. MovieClip "BottleModel"
It creates a MovieClip "BottleModel" to control a 3D bottle of champagne. Then it rotations automatically. The speed of rotation will be changed. That depends on the movement of the mouse.

2. Sprite "Bottle"
It creates a Sprite "Bottle" to load a 3DMAX model. And it has  a public function which sets the rotation properties.
